# 🎭 Ongo the Art Collector
Ongo is a theatrical AI art critic who reacts to your uploaded images with over-the-top praise or scathing ridicule. He might call your work “Derivative!” or celebrate a flaming dumpster as a symbol of late-stage capitalism.

## 🖼️ What It Does
You upload an image.

- GPT-4o-mini (via Replicate) generates a caption.
- Ongo critiques it — praising trash, mocking classics.
- ElevenLabs voices his reaction in absurd, high-society flair.
- Sometimes, he skips the critique and yells a pre-recorded interjection.

## ⚙️ Built With
- Flask – Web framework
- Replicate – To run GPT-4o-mini for captioning & critique
- ElevenLabs – For realistic voice synthesis
- HTML / JS / Bootstrap – Frontend interface
